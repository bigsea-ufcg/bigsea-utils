This program starts a given amount of threads to execute factorial operations, waiting some time between them. 
The input value for these operations and the amount of time waited them is randomized.

How to use

run.sh n_threads sleep_min sleep_max factorial_n_min factorial_n_max n_executions stress_trigger n_stress output_file

n_threads: number of threads started to execute factorial operations. Each thread executes n_executions factorial operations.
sleep_min: the minimum wait time between executions, in seconds.
sleep_max: the maximum wait time between executions, in seconds.
factorial_n_min: the lowest value used as argument to the factorial function.
factorial_n_max: the highest value used as argument to the factorial function.
n_executions: number of executions of factorial performed by each thread.
stress_trigger: If the random function used to decide the next input for the factorial function returns a value greater than strigger_trigger, the thread will use n_stress as input for the factorial function.
